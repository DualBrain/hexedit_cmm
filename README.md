HexEdit Binary File Editor by Epsilon
-------------------------------------
Current Version: 0.1

ChangeLog
---------
0.1:
- Initial version.

Description
-----------
HexEdit allows you to edit binary files, i.e. files that you can't edit with a regular text editor such as the built-in editor.

The file's contents are shown as hexadecimal byte values and as ASCII code in two side-by-side blocks. Changes can be made both in the hex table section and in the ASCII section.

The usual file navigation with cursors keys, page up&down, home, end, etc. should work as expected.

Hexedit is a full-screen console-only editor. I does not work over serial, sorry.
